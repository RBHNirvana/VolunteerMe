# VolunteerMe
Project for NwHacks 2021
# Inspiration
We wanted to assist all high school students who would want to look for any volunteer work available

# What it does
It allows organizations to to list any volunteer opportunities while allowing volunteers to look through and pick up any volunteer opportunities available in any select area they choose.

# How we built it
We utilized visual studio code to use the languages listed below:
CSS
Flask
HTML
Python
SQLAlchemy
